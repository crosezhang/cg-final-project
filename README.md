# cg-final-project
Designed to be run on Linux OS using anaconda.

Begin by creating a new environment in anaconda 
```
conda create -n cont-detection
conda activate cont-detection
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels itsmeludo
```

Then, install krakenuniq using the following command
```
conda install -c bioconda krakenuniq
```
We will be using the minikraken 8GB database with krakenuniq to allow our program to run on most machines regardless of processing power. Download this database using the following commands. The complete download should take around 5 minutes. The uncompressing process also should take a few minutes.

```
curl -O https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/dl/minikraken_20171019_8GB.tgz
mkdir minikraken
tar -xvzf minikraken_20171019_8GB.tgz -C ./minikraken
mv ./minikraken/minikraken_20171019_8GB/* ./minikraken
rm -r ./minikraken/minikraken_20171019_8GB
```

After setting up krakenuniq and the associated minikraken database, install phyloligo with conda
```
conda install phyloligo -c itsmeludo
```

Once you have all of the appropriate packages installed, you should be able to run the bash file using the following command and entering the appropriate arguments
```
bash cont-pipeline.sh <input-filename> <output-filename>
```
